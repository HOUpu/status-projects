# Information
__status-projects__ repository aims to gather the status of my projects together, once I am having trouble in managing my time versus the amount of projects I have. I am also unable to understand my productivity and my resources, thus ending up never finishing any of them.

## Why should you use it?
- You can visualize better your tasks and projects. So do others!
- __Status Projects__ is right inside your GitHub and even better, right inside your Markdown files.
- You can work directly from your favourite Web Browser.
- It's better for working on team projects because everyone can spot one's task.
- It helps you to take decisions.
- No extra tools required, nor extra logins.

### Getting Started
I wrote a very ```quick``` guide about how to get started with this project on [http://luizperes.github.io/status-projects/](http://luizperes.github.io/status-projects/), so please take a look at that or open my README.md file on ```Raw``` mode. :)

## CS50

[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!) is the first course of Introduction to Computer Science inside the [Open Source Society University (OSSU)](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science). I am taking this course to get to know the best ways to teach ICC. This course has its priority **higher** than the others because it is going to be taught up to **May 01, 2016**.

## Artoo Editor
[Artoo Editor](https://github.com/luizperes/artoo-editor) is a text editor for terminals bases on the ncurses library. I am trying to go on this project in slow pace, and despite of not updating this project so much, I put my wrists on this every now and then.

<div align="center"><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=250x100&chd=t:20,5,75&chco=8BC34A,CDDC39,C8E6C9&chl=Done|In%20Progress|To%20Do' alt='Chart CS50)' height='100' width='250' /></div>

## Swift

I am trying to read and understand all the documentation of [the Swift Programming Language](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id1002622538?mt=11) book.

<div align="center"><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=250x100&chd=t:30,70&chl=Read|Not%20Read' alt='Chart CS50)' height='100' width='250' /></div>

## Assembly

I am also trying to read and understand all the book [Art of Assembly x86](http://www.plantation-productions.com/Webster/www.artofasm.com/Windows/PDFs/0_PDFIndexWin.html) as it should be useful in the future.

<div align="center"><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=250x100&chd=t:30,70&chl=Read|Not%20Read' alt='Chart CS50)' height='100' width='250' /></div>

## Ballsy

[Ballsy](https://github.com/ideiadoluiz/ballsy-doodle) is an iOS game that uses SpriteKit engine. This game is still a mistery for me and I am trying to figure things out before getting back to work on it. I am not sure yet about the game play!

<div align="center"><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=250x100&chd=t:5,0,95&chco=8BC34A,CDDC39,C8E6C9&chl=Done|In%20Progress|To%20Do' alt='Chart CS50)' height='100' width='250' /></div>

## Stepss

[Stepss](https://github.com/luizperes/TStepProject) is another mistery for me, even though I work on this project for 2 or 3 months straight, but that was on September, 2015. I need to either continue or stop this project. 

<div align="center"><img src='https://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=p&chs=250x100&chd=t:60,0,40&chco=8BC34A,CDDC39,C8E6C9&chl=Done|In%20Progress|To%20Do' alt='Chart CS50)' height='100' width='250' /></div>

## Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://github.com/DestructHub/ProjectEuler) is a compilation of some solutions of the challenges existent in the website [www.projecteuler.net](www.projecteuler.net). This project is one of my favourite ones, because it deals with hard mathematical/computational problems. The sad thing is that I can only help them after finishing my other projects.

## Brainfuck Interpreter

[Brainfuck Interpreter](https://github.com/luizperes/BrainfuckInterpreter) is a repository of an interpreter written in C for the esoteric programming language Brainfuck. It's been working quite properly and I also added two new structures to that language. Actually, I am thinking of changing it quite a bit, thus, I might change this repository name in the future... :)

## Beezy Bee

[Beezy Bee](https://github.com/cornerstonecollege/beezy-bee) is an arcade-style game inspired on "Flappy Bird" made by the students I teach at [Cornerstone College](http://ciccc.ca). Beezy Bee is meant so far for iOS devices and I helped and guided them to idealize the solution as well as solve the problems that they had while developing this project.

## Fartometer

[Fartometer](https://github.com/ideiadoluiz/FartometerIOSProject) is my last year's favourite project. This project allows you to see on your iPhone how strong your farts are! The project is basically an Arduino device with a BLE Shield, and if you want, you can also detect any kind of gas in the air by only changing the gas sensor. If you want to get to know how to build your own, please visit: [How to build your own fartometer](http://www.ideiadoluiz.com.br/site/how-to-build-your-own-fartometer/)
