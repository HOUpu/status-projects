# Information
__status-projects__ repository aims to gather the status of my projects together, once I am having trouble in managing my time vs lots of projects. I am also unable to understand my productivity and my resources, thus ending up never finishing any of them.

### General status of my current Projects

## CS50

[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#!) is the first course of Introduction to Computer Science inside the [Open Source Society University (OSSU)](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science). I am taking this course to get to know the best ways to teach ICC. This course has its priority **higher** than the others because it is going to be taught up to **May 01, 2016**.
